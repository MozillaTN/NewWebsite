<p><strong>6) How did you discover the Web?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Through my family and friends. Well, it all started with creating mail then got associated with the web as such.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7) How did you hear about Mozilla and Mozilla Tamilnadu Community?</strong></p>
<p>At my University, I attended an orientation. In the orientation, one of my seniors took the session about Mozilla and its Contributing areas. After that orientation, I came to my room and searched about Firefox Student Ambassador. Then I saw one Mozcafe event which was conducted by D.Vigneshwar in Thanjavur. I attended the session and then joined the Mozilla Tamil Nadu community.</p>
<p>.<strong>8) How and why did you start contributing to Mozilla?</strong></p>
<p>Actually, I like to learn something new apart from my academics and improve my skills by those concerns, I  joined in Mozilla then became a Mozilla FSA. It’s really pretty cool to get some ideas. Before entering into Mozilla I didn’t have much knowledge in Computer Science and by contributing in Mozilla Localization Service and done with great Success, I am in a great hope to contribute in other areas and now I am interested in Mozilla L10N.</p>
<p><strong>9) What’s the contribution you’re the proudest of?</strong></p>
<p>Secured third place in Tamilnadu in Mozilla Location Service(MLS) is my proudest moment as of now as it is my first contributing area.</p>
<p><strong>10) What advice would you give to someone who is new and interested in contributing to Mozilla?</strong></p>
<p>Feel free with Mozilla Community, don’t feel shy to ask anything. Language doesn’t matter and your basic knowledge is enough to do everything because here you have a chance to learn a lot. Community members are always ready to help you anytime.</p>
<p><strong>11) If you had one word or sentence to describe Mozilla, what would it be?</strong></p>
<p>Simply Awesome</p>
<p><strong>12) What exciting things do you envision for you and Mozilla in the future?</strong></p>
<p>I concentrate on developing this Mozilla community in remote areas, due to less awareness in rural areas we are in the position to improve there also.</p>
<p><strong>13) Is there anything else you'd like to say or add to the above questions?</strong></p>
<p>No, I feel these questions are more than enough.</p>
<p><strong>14) Please tell us more about your community. Is there anything you find particularly interesting or special about it?</strong></p>
<p>Like I said before, here after my community will be improved in rural areas. Since after coming to a reputed University, I got a chance to know about Mozilla, before that I know Mozilla Firefox as a browser alone, I wasn’t aware of these things behind Mozilla and really am amazed.</p>
<p><strong>15) What’s your best memory of your fellow community members?</strong></p>
<p>After I joined in a Mozilla community, I didn’t know anything about it, what I have to do, which area would suit me I confused a lot and assumed myself that I am not fit for these things. Then a guy Gowtham encouraged me and helped me a lot. Representatives gave some ideas to do my basic steps for creating a blog, manage a GitHub etc...</p>
