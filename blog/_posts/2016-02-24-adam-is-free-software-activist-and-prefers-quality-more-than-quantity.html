Wow man, We Get the Internet In our City like that Feelings. Thats time<b> I First Discover the Web with an Mobile Handset.</b></p>
<p><b>7) How did you hear about Mozilla and Mozilla Tamilnadu Community?</b></p>
<p>First thing I'm Verymuch Thankful to<b> (REP)  SyedKhaleel </b>bro, because He Only Said About Firefox Student Ambassador Program and He only Introduced me Mozilla. He told me the links of MozillaWiki page, I Started following What he is Contributing  Towards Mozilla. When I Searched in Mozilla Wiki page, There I Found a <b>RAL</b> Name <b>Mayur Patil</b>, I Asked him about what can I do, What are contributions I Can do from my City, Who can Help me out, then he give an facebook link of <b>Mozillians Tamilnadu, </b>So he Tell me to Follow the Page, They Posted an update about Weeks of Contributions in Mozillians Tamilnadu, I Participated and Learn Manythings from them. Then by <b>(REP) Viswa Prasath</b> Guided me more by Shaping my Contribution towards mozilla. He had given me So many Ideas and Advices to me. Thanks to Mozilla Tamilnadu Community. And verymuch Thankful to Viswa Prasath bro,Naresh(REP) bro, and to my Friend RAL Karthickeyan too.</p>
<p><b>8) How and why did you start contributing to Mozilla?</b></p>
<p>I'm verymuch Intrested to Contribute towards Mozilla. Because there are many Computer Science Students in myCity or in my College, but I want to be an Real Engineer in myCity, Which means to be an Thoughtful Engineer, Working with Technological Internet of things, Contributing towards OpenSource projects. So I choosen Mozilla. When I Started Following SyedKhaleel bro, he Teached me more about Localisation(<b>L10</b>), He conducted Several Events in our Hometown Viluppuram, I Participated and I attended the  Many events in Tamilnadu, Hyderabad, kerala etc. and contributed to L10n too. Then Im Verymuch Interested in Blogging and Documentation, I Started My Contribution towards<b> MDN</b> and then Im  intrested more in Testing &amp; QA. So Now Im  Activiely Contributing to<b> QA. </b></p>
<p><b>9) What’s the contribution you’re the most proud of?</b></p>
<p>The Contribution made me Proud is that When Im Made an meetup and Made an Event in Thiruvannamalai for the SKP College Students and Recurit 40 new Students in FSA Program and mozilla Too. That Contribution is much Loved by Mozilla and They Given me</p>
<p><b>FSA of the Month </b>recognition received from mozilla in WorldWide. Then I So much Excited to do more Contributions towards Mozilla in QA pathways and Made Several Events too. Then I Surprised to get recognition as <b>FSA Superstars </b>in Mozilla. These Two things Prouded  me Most.</p>
<p><b>10) What advice would you give to someone who is new and interested in contributing to Mozilla?</b></p>
<p><b><i>Learn fully, Read the Activities of Exciting FSA’s or Read the Blogposts of FSA and Reps too.  Contribute More then Make an huge Event, got Recognition or Proof of Identification from Mozilla</i></b> then request the College management. Because most of the <b><i>Colleges expect proofs </i></b>to execute such things like Building Community etc.</p>
<p><b>11) If you had one word or sentence to describe Mozilla, what would it be?</b></p>
<p><b>Best Place for the OpenWeb </b>and Best Place for Learning Morethings about openSource Contribution by all pathways. Best Place for all College Students to <b>Gain More Experience</b> in Contribution over OpenSource and <b>Exploring</b> their Experience in this world.</p>
<p><b>12) What exciting things do you envision for you and Mozilla in the future?</b></p>
<p>The NewContributors or New FSA can be Handled by Senior FSA or by RAL or by REP. So they can Easily Contribute to any parts of Mozilla. So It can make an Healthy Community or it can make an Good Knowledge Sharing platform.</p>
<p><b>13) Is there anything else you'd like to say or add to the above questions?</b></p>
<p>FSA program and Mozilla Communities all over the world can make the Students Life more better then they think. It is the Best Part of Mozilla.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>15) Please tell us more about your community. Is there anything you find particularly interesting or special about it?</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mozilla Tamilnadu Community is always think unique, Because they will follow all the contributors work, and mentoring them in a RightWay what all the contributors  are Intrested, what they needed, guide them in any pathways.That is the Special One about MozillaTN Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>16) What’s your best memory with your fellow community members?</b></p>
