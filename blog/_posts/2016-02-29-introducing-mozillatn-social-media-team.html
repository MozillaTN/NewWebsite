<p>So in July 2014 some of the contributors in Tamilnadu came forward and wanted to form a Mozilla Tamilnadu Community (Contributors Community). They planned for events both online and offline tried to gather every Mozilla Contributor in Tamilnadu under Common banner. At the time of Start there were various city level community which still actively exist, we had Chennai, Coimbaore, Villupuram, Erode, Trichy, and so on. At that time when we looked at community we were very small in size, and also knowledge transfer was very less compared to What we have now. On Average we had 1 event per month.</p>
<p>Now all the contributors from  cities in Tamilnadu came forward to build Mozilla Tamilnadu Community, it looks really very big. Some of the interesting stats to check are below</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MozillaTN" target="_blank">Facebook</a> - 419 Likes 30- Reach avg</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/mozillaTN/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> -   113 Followers</li>
<li><a href="http://mozillatn.github.io/" target="_blank">Website</a> -  5 Visits per day Avg</li>
<li><a href="https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@mozillatn" target="_blank">Telegram Channel </a>-  64 Followers 40 reach avg</li>
</ul>
<p>We still have some left like Google Groups, Facebook groups, personal Emails exchanged and so on.</p>
<p>But even today we have not made many things properly  like creating event in Facebook or Google+ for each and every event done by Contributors, share about the awesome events done by contributors, sharing thoughts about Awesome Contributors (just recently we started <a href="https://mozillianstn.wordpress.com/category/contributor-spotlight/" target="_blank">contributor spotlight</a>). We have some to-do lists below</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving the engagement in Facebook and Twitter</li>
<li>Branding events in college by FSA in Tamilnadu. (helping in setting up event in FB, hashtag)</li>
<li>Making Contributors blogpost Visible to all community members.</li>
<li>If possible bringing content in Tamil</li>
<li>Maintaining the Community Calendar</li>
<li>Creating designs for Community events.</li>
</ul>
<p>To do the above mentioned things we need a dedicated set of contributors who have focused much in Social Media. Two weeks back I have asked people to share how they can improve our Social Media presence. 7 people shown interest among them 3 have been chosen to maintain our Social Media accounts along with the existing Admin.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was really great to select this three people among 7 who shown interest. They have very good ideas running in their mind and wanted to try those and bring awesome interaction to our Community.</p>
<p>Some of the Goals shared by them which they would like to achieve by the end of 2016.</p>
